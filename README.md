The project agenda for launching the Indoor Fort Building Kit entails confronting skepticism about the product's value and securing initial investors by showcasing its potential success. Beginning with an overview of the $4 million investment required for production facilities, we outline projections for year 1 sales of 80,000 kits at $25 each, with annual sales growth expected thereafter. We delve into the cost structure, detailing variable costs and declining SG&A expenses. Strategic planning encompasses market penetration strategies, branding efforts, and goal setting, particularly focusing on repaying the initial investment by year 5. Risk management strategies are discussed to mitigate potential challenges, and investor engagement is prioritized to garner support and confidence in the project's trajectory. In conclusion, the agenda underscores our confidence in the product's viability and commitment to delivering returns for investors by utilizing the Net Present Value(NPV), inviting collaboration and investment in achieving our objectives.
